 
## Overview: A Smart AI Assistant for Finding Lecture Slide Content 
 
Lecture Navigator is an AI-powered assistant designed to help students in TKH to quickly find materials that was discussed across a large collection of Data Science & Machine Learning lecture slides. By asking questions like "Where did we talk about Euclidean distance?", users receive precise slide references and page numbers—saving time and improving reviewing process.
 
This tool leverages OpenAI's Assistants API, a vector database, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable context-aware search grounded in actual slide content. The tool has been built with hallucination control in mind and aims for citation-level precision.

Setup Instructions
 
How to Run
 
To run this application locally:
1. Clone the Repo
2. Install Dependencies
Run:
pip install python-dotenv faiss-cpu sentence-transformers openai
 
3. Prepare the Environment
Create a .env file in the project root:
API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PROJECT_ID=your_openai_project_id
VEC_ID=your_vector_store_id
4. Upload Lecture Slides
All course PDFs should be placed in the data/ directory
 
# This script loops through and uploads each PDF into the vector DB
from your_module import upload_pdf
 
for file in os.listdir('data/'):
    if file.endswith(".pdf"):
        upload_pdf(f"data/{file}")
 
5. Ask a Question
print(ask("What is the difference between KNN and K-means?"))

                                        Formatted response
 
 
 
Embeddings: Slides are converted to vector form using sentence-transformers.
Vector DB: FAISS (CPU) stores vectors for fast semantic search.
RAG: OpenAI’s Assistants API uses search hits to generate accurate responses.
System Prompt: Custom prompt ensures only grounded, citation-formatted answers.
